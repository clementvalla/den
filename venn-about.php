       <p>Venn diagrams or set diagrams are diagrams that show all possible 
               logical relations between a finite collection of sets (aggregation 
               of things). Venn diagrams were conceived around 1880 by John Venn. 
               They are used to teach elementary set theory, as well as illustrate 
               simple set relationships in probability, logic, statistics, linguistics 
               and computer science (see logical connectives).
